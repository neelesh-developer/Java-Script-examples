
TypeScript  -- object oriented way of writing javascript


TypeScript is strictly type checked language -- so mentioning data type beside to variable is mandatory and so only respective type of data is allowed to assign

Variables :
  let variableName:dataType = value

  ex: let id:number = 90;
      let name:string = "java";


 Functions :

    function addNumbers(argumentName:argumentType):returnType{
        //
        //
        return
    }

    --> unlike javascript, typescript wont allow more than expected no of input values
    --> unlike javascript, typescript wont allow less than expected no of input values
    --> unlike javascript, typescript wont allow values of unexpected argument types
    --> unlike javascript, in typescript we do can define  optional parameters

    Passing values for optional parameters is optional

Iterables :

  for of   -- during iteration process we get values 1 by 1

  for in   -- during iteration process we get the index position into local variable


Class : is a template to hold the properties of an entity

Object : is the memory through which we store the data of an entity

Relation between class and object ---- Class will always be defined only once and through taking class as reference we can create n no of objects



constructor  -- is used to pass on the values to the object during object creation time itself
